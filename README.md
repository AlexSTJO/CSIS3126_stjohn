# 🐳 Orca: Cloud Data Orchestration

Orca is a lightweight cloud orchestration tool designed to simplify the execution of data pipelines on AWS infrastructure. It enables users to upload Python tasks, manage execution order, track logs, and automate AWS resource provisioning—all from a simple and extensible interface.

## 🚀 Features

- Upload and organize Python-based tasks
- Define and manage execution order with an S3-hosted manifest
- Orchestrate task execution on EC2 via AWS Systems Manager (SSM)
- Stream live output and logs from your cloud instance
- Bootstrap environments dynamically with dependency management
- Secure credential handling via AWS Secrets Manager
- Integrated with Flask (backend), Vue.js (frontend), and Nginx (deployment)
